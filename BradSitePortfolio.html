                    Ishing is a game jam submission for the Performance Game Jam 2023. I solo-developed this 2D
                    fishing game with mechanics similar to other popular titles with fishing mini-games. In Ishing,
                    players travel the map to catch fish, sell fish, and buy upgrades until they purchase their own
                    personal island. All assets made by myself. Made in Unity. Published on Itch.

                    Childlike - the Awakening is a game made for release on Halloween 2023. I worked together with a colleague
                    to create this 3D enviromental horror game. In this game, players take on the role of a child in a scary house 
                    where they will navigate an unsettling environment, interact with objects,
                    and experience brief scares as they work their way back to their parents. 
                    Childlike - the Awakening uses third-party assets we downloaded from the asset store.
                    Made in Unity. Published on Itch.

                    Dungeon Dice Frogs is a game jam submission for the Mini Jam 106: Frogs Game Jam.
                    I worked together with a colleague to create this 3D heaxgonal tile turn-based game
                    where players choose frogs, who are also dice, and use them by rolling and fighting
                    against an A.I. enemy. This game is currently still in a private repo but can be played
                    on my itch page. The github icon for this description will redirect to the itch page. Made in Unity. Published on Itch.

                    One Room Dungeon is a game jam submission for the IndieTales Game Jam. I worked alone to
                    design, program, and create the assets for this level-based 2D shooter where the walls can be moved
                    and move on their own. Made in Unity. Published on Itch.

                    Fishing Craze is an easy to grasp fishing game where players use angle and strength
                    to throw a bobber into the ocean. Fish swim inbetween invisible nodes, and the player can pull a fish
                    out of the water once they are touching the bobber. Made in Unity. All assets made locally.

                    Project Exclesior is my first attempt at creating an original game with networking and multiplayer functionality.
                    The idea of the game is that a group of adventurers (players) are exploring a location for gold, and one adventurer 
                    is attempting to vanquish the other adventurers before the gold goal is reached. Made in Unity. Uses third-party assets.

                    Quest is one of my first ever Unity game creations after college. 
                    Quest is a choice driven exploration game where players are attempting to escape a cave after their
                    village is attacked and they are captured.
                    The game is built using Unity Scriptable objects. Made in Unity. All assets made locally.

                    SpaceJam originally started as a simple clone of the popular Galaga game.
                    It eventually evolved into a small "runner-like" game that I fully-developed
                    and play on my phone from time to time. Made in Unity. All assets made by myself.

                    N's game is a small 2D sidescrolling hack-n-slash game I made for a friend's birthday.
                    He was turning 24 at the time, and on defeating the 24th enemy it shared a small happy birthday message.
                    N's game uses third-party assets I downloaded from the asset store.
